# CashFlow

This program simulates some functions used for cash flow at a bank.

The instructions for compilation and running the files are as follows:
  "make" will compile all source files
  run with "java -ea Driver" where the flag "-ea" is to enable assert
  "make clean" will clean up the .class files created after compilation if needed
  
 Any notes or comments can be found in the CashFlow.java file but to summarize:
  CashFlow.java file does the main processing and calculations.
  Event.java is a helper class for tracking specific transactions
  Driver.java is for testing
  makefile is a generic makefile for compilation
